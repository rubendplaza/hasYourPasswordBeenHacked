# hasYourPasswordBeenHacked
This script allows you to enter your passwords through the command line and check it across an online database of breached passwords. 
The API used to check the database doesn't receive your actual password but rather uses the hash of the first five characters in your 
password to check it securely. Uses https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords API
